Bitmaps
# A bitmap is a data structure: A way of storing bits of information
# The term bitmap specifically refers to a map of bits. It is basically a matrix of bits.
# Bitmap images are actually pix-maps.
        $ A pix-map is a map of pixels
        $ Bitmap images have 1 bit per pixel; pix-map images have multiple bits per pixel
                % An example is Microsoft Paint that saves bitmaps with 24 bits per pixel.
# The distinction between bitmaps and pix-maps doesn't seem to be strictly enforced in online sources. 
# Most image file formats are bitmaps. This includes JPEG, TIFF, and PNG. All these formats are compressed bitmaps.
        $ The term bitmap file usually refers to the uncompressed BMP format. 
                % This format stores the pixels of an imagine in a logical matrix of pixels (where each pixel is a certain number of bytes).
